                            The brainchild of The DebaterVerse and Happivibe Services, two organizations focused on growing large communities of young people and helping them use their voices and talents to create real change.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Involving over 1,000 young people from all parts of the country sharing the same accommodation for 5 days. The ANYDC is the place to create ideas, friends, and memories that last a lifetime.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The activities, featuring everything from debating to movies and games are structured to be inclusive, casual, and informal.

                        <p>
                            Giving you a healthy balance of social and intellectual excitement with no restrictions with regards to dressing, language, or mannerisms. An exhibition of freedom. Something seriously lacking in Nigeria today.

                        <p>
                            And to cap it all, after a week of excitement and cruise. The National Youth Conference gives you a chance to hear ideas, listen to and interact with experienced social and business leaders and compete for even more exciting rewards.
